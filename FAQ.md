#### Build fails with cannot find module aws-exports

The following error is generated when your app cannot find the `aws-exports.js` file.
```tsx
TS2307: Cannot find module 'aws-exports'
```

The aws-exports.js file is generated by the Amplify CLI during your backend build. Add the following code snippet to your build spec to resolve the error. This will create the aws-exports.js file for use in the build.

```tsx
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - '# Execute Amplify CLI with the helper script'
        - amplifyPush --simple
```

#### How do I override a build timeout
The default build timeout is 30 minutes, if your build takes more than 30 minutes, you can override the default build timeout using an env variable: _BUILD_TIMEOUT (App settings > Environment variables).

#### How do I pull private packages during a build.

Create your own key pair and add the private key as an environment variable in the Amplify app. Add the public key to the repository you would like to clone. You could then add the key to the ssh-agent on the build instance during build and git clone the second repository.

1. create the keypair without a password:

```
ssh-keygen -f deploy_key -N ""
```

2. encode it and copy the output into an Environment Variable in the Amplify Console (eg DEPLOY_KEY)

```
cat deploy_key | base64 | tr -d n

```

3. add the contents of deploy_key.pub to the access keys of the private repo you want to access

4. then in amplify.yml

```
commands:
        - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        - ssh-add <(echo "$DEPLOY_KEY" | base64 -d)
```

#### How do I run Amplify functions with python runtime

[Amplify lambda functions need python 3.8.x or above.](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/function#function-templates). Our build image supports both python 3.7.9 which is aliased under `python3`, and python 3.8 which is aliased under `python3.8`. In order to you use `python3` with python 3.8 version, use the following commands (*create symlink to link python3 to python3.8 and install pipenv using pip3.8*).

```
version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.8 11
        - /usr/local/bin/pip3.8 install --user pipenv
        - amplifyPush --simple
```
